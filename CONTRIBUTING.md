# Contributing

As a contributor, please acknowledge and agree that:

- The project maintainers may adjust the open-source license terms as necessary to make them either more strict or more relaxed.  
- Any code you contribute may be used for commercial purposes, including but not limited to the project’s cloud-based operations.


## Creating a Pull Request

Pull requests (PRs) are always welcome — even small ones that fix typos or minor issues.  
If your contribution involves significant work or new features, please open an issue first to start a discussion before you begin implementation.

Please break down your changes into small, focused PRs whenever possible.  
Large PRs with many features or extensive changes are difficult to review and may take longer to merge. Incremental submissions are strongly encouraged.

These development guidelines provide information about the repository structure, how to set up your development environment, how to run the project, and more.

**Note:** When splitting a feature into multiple PRs, please ensure that each individual PR can be safely merged into the `master` branch without breaking existing functionality.  
If a PR introduces incomplete or non-functional changes, it will not be merged until the feature is complete.

## Reporting Issues

Reporting issues is a great way to contribute to the project.  
Well-written and detailed bug reports are always appreciated! Please open a new issue and fill out all required information using the provided template.

Before opening a new issue, please check the existing issue list to avoid duplicates.  
If a similar issue already exists, you can subscribe to it to receive updates.  
If you have additional information to share, please add it as a comment on that issue.

When reporting an issue, please include the following information:

- The version you are using  
- Steps to reproduce the problem  
- Screenshots or log files, if applicable

Because all issues are public, please ensure that you remove any sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords, IP addresses, or company names) from your submissions.  
Replace sensitive data with placeholders such as `REDACTED` or `****`.
